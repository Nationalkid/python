==========================
Combining Pyqt and Plotly
==========================

This script gets an input data (excel file) and generates an
interactive Likert scale plot using the Plotly library

An example using the likert scale
----------------------------------

The example is based on a small sample of data of Villanueva's thesis.
The input data was produced after qualitative survey to understand people's perception on
how much they value ecosystem services towards some landscapes.

The ecosystem services were the following :

- Food
- Wood
- Water_supply
- Regulation
- Air_quality
- Scenic_beauty

With four possible land scapes :

- Agriculture
- Forest
- Settlement
- Grassland

Through the GUI the user can select his data, the ecosystem service and the land scape. Additionally,
people are group people by gender, age, age class, education and activity.
